Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/alireza12prom" rel="noreferrer">Alireza</a> ðŸ‘‹

<p>
This project developed with OOP(Object Oriented Programming) concept. It may seem difficult to work with this app at first but
I tried to find it as best as possible. 
For start working with this app you shoud write commands like git! Therefore, by learning the pre-defined commands, 
you can use this app very easily. I have listed the things that can be done with this app in the bottom section:
  
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Create custom todo lists <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Create custom tasks <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Adding a tasks as Important <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Adding a tasks in Myday list(It means you want do it today) <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Renaming a custom todo list(after created it) <br>
 &nbsp; :heavy_check_mark: Each task have a title, date, state and description and you can change it(after created it) <br>


Of course, this app has many problems and shortcomings:cry:, but as the first version developed by a new programmer, it is the best of its kind.:stuck_out_tongue:
